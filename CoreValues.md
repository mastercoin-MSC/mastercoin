After more than a year of operations, it's time to define our core values.
The purpose of a core value document is to capture and communicate the reason for the existence of the Foundation.

These values can be treated like [Asimov's laws of robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics). Each value is upheld except when it contradicts with a previous value.

1. Do good. There is no agreed upon definition of "doing good" so this must be left for the individual to interpert.
2. [Radical Honesty](http://www.radicalhonesty.com/) - We will never lie (except to protect value #1).
3. Transparency - we will seek to voluntarily broadcast the maximal amount of information we can to the public.
4. Freedom - we will seek to maximize the freedom and rights enjoyed by any individual or group. 
5. Dedication - Do. Or do not. [There is no try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4yd2W50No).
6. Empathy - We will seek to understand and empathize with different views even when we disagree with them.
7. Safety - We will maintain an environment of safety. Safety to disagree,expand,innovate or to ask for help.
8. Knowledge - The more we learn the more we realize we don't know. #Always Be Learning. 

*A nice footnote I'd like to present as many are not familiar : [The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
