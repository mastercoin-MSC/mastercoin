After more than a year of operations, it's time to define our mission statement and core values.

Mission Statement
=================
We make decentralized tools to empower your dream, build wealth, and replace every aspect of finance.

Core Values
===========
The purpose of a core value document is to capture and communicate the reason for the existence of the Foundation.

These values can be treated like [Asimov's laws of robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics). Each value is upheld except when it contradicts with a previous value.

1. Do good - There is no agreed upon definition of "doing good" so this must be left for the individual to interpert.
2. [Radical Honesty](http://www.radicalhonesty.com/) - We will never lie (except to protect value #1).
3. Transparency - We will seek to voluntarily broadcast the maximal amount of information we can to the public.
4. Freedom - We will seek to maximize the freedom and rights enjoyed by any individual or group. 
5. Fearlessness - Realize that [Fear is the mind killer](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2-i-must-not-fear-fear-is-the-mind-killer-fear-is), and strive to make decisions not from a place of fear, but rather from understanding.
6. Dedication - Do. Or do not. [There is no try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4yd2W50No).
7. Empathy - We will seek to understand and empathize with different views even when we disagree with them.
8. Safety - We strive to maintain an environment in which it is safe to be honest, criticize, ask for clarity or enhance. We won't punish someone for not understanding or voicing their opinions.
